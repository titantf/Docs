# Custom Content

<Callout type="info">
  Titan 3 will support asynchronous downloads. Players will automatically
  download custom content after connecting to the server. This guide will be
  updated.
</Callout>

## Content Pack

All custom items such as battle calls, medic cries, emotes and trails are part of the "optional content pack" or "DLC". It is a completely optional bundle of content that does not automatically download when a player connects to our community game servers.

This measure was done to cut all unnecessary download times for players who only want to play on the servers without ever interacting outside the base features.

<Callout>
  Players who did not download the content pack will not see the emotes you use,
  trails you are wearing, and the sounds you play. Others who download them will
  be able to see and hear them.
</Callout>

### Installation

The content pack can be obtained by connecting to the content distributor at the IP address: **download.titan.tf:11111**

Don't worry, the installation process is automatic and the game will notify you as soon as it finishes installing. The simplest way to connect to it via the IP address is to enter the following line into the address bar of your browser.

```text
steam://connect/download.titan.tf:11111
```

Alternatively, you can enable your Team Fortress 2 developer console and connect through it by following the screenshots below.

### Updating

Updating is the same as the installation process. You can update your content pack by connecting to the content distributor at the IP address: **download.titan.tf:11111**

Similarly, you can follow the connection guide in the [installation section](https://app.gitbook.com/@titantf/s/wiki/items/content-packs#installation) above if you do not know how to connect to a server using the server's IP address.

### Customize

You can adjust the volume of sounds played to you after you have the optional content pack installed. Head over to [settings](https://titan.tf/settings), and follow the screenshot below.
