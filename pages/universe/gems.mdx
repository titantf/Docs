# Gems ðŸ’Ž

A currency that bridges the exchange of currencies between Titan and Team Fortress 2.

Gems can be used to buy Team Fortress 2 items, and likewise can be purchased with Team Fortress 2 items at a rate of 1,000 gems / scrap \(used to be 900\).

They can be converted into Titan Credits at a rate of $0.30 / gem. However, Titan Credits **cannot be converted back into Gems**. Gems can also be used to purchase some specialty items such as EXP Packs \(to instantly boost your XP\) from the exchange.
