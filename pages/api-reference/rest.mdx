# Getting Started

## What is REST?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used. REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications.

If you only need to access publicly available data, the REST API is the best choice.

## Authentication

<Steps>
### Generate an API Key

You can obtain an API key through the [developer portal](https://titan.tf/developer/api). You will need to provide a name, description and expiry date for this key.

### Authenticate with Access Tokens

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. Use your API key to generate an access token and refresh token.

Only the access token will be returned to you. Access tokens are valid for 5 minutes and can be used to make requests to the API.

<Callout type="warning">

The refresh token is used to generate new access tokens. It is
stored encrypted on the server-side and expires on the expiry date
specified for the API key.

It is not possible to modify the expiry date unless a new API key
is generated.

</Callout>

### Renewing Access Tokens

Access tokens can be renewed using the old access token at this endpoint `https://api.titan.tf/api/v1/auth/renew-token`.

The API will use the matching refresh token to generate a new access token.
