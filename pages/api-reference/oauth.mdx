# Getting Started

## What is OAuth?

OAuth allows applications to retrieve data from titan.tf on behalf of a user. For example, you can use OAuth to allow users to log in to your website using their titan.tf account without having to ask for their password.

See [Scopes](/api-reference/oauth-scopes) for more information on what data you can access. If you only need to access publicly available data, you do not need OAuth. Use the REST API instead.

<Callout type="warning">
  The OAuth API is not currently available for public use. If you have any
  questions or feedback, please contact us on Discord.

## Authentication

<Steps>
### Create a OAuth App

Create an OAuth app on the [developer portal](https://titan.tf/developer/oauth). You will need to provide a name, description, and redirect URL for your app. The redirect URL is where users will be sent after they authorize your app.

### Get the Client ID and Client Secret

After creating your app, you will be given a Client ID and Client Secret. You will need these to authenticate your app.

### Redirect the user to the authorization URL

To authorize your app, you must redirect the user to the authorization URL. The authorization URL is `https://titan.tf/api/v1/oauth/authorize` with the following query parameters:

- `client_id` - The Client ID of your app
- `redirect_uri` - The redirect URL of your app
- `response_type` - Must be `code`

</Steps>
