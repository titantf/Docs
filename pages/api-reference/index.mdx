# Introduction

This section is for developers. Titan Api allows you to access data about Titan servers, players, and more. You can build your own 3rd party applications and services that make use of this.

It is a seamless way to retrieve data from titan.tf without having to scrape the website, & it is completely free to use! Usage must comply within the [terms of use](#terms-of-use).

If you have any feedback or questions, feel free to reach out to us on Discord.

## Rate Limits

There is a hard rate limit of 90 requests per minute for both authenticated and non-authenticated requests in REST and OAuth.

When making a request to the api, you will receive these headers in the response:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 90
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 78
```

## Terms of Use

1. Free for non-commercial use.
2. Data harvesting from the API in bulk is absolutely forbidden.
3. Applications and services using our API must explicitly state themselves as **"UNOFFICIAL"** app/services that are not directly endorsed by Titan.
4. Abuse of APIs or services may result in the termination of your access to the API.
5. We reserve the right to change these terms at any time without notice.

## Commercial Use

The API is prohibited from being used in any commercial software or services that generates more than $100 in monthly revenue. If you wish to use the API in a commercial product, please contact us at [api@titan.tf](mailto:api@titan.tf).
