#### ❤️ More than just another gaming community

There's always something for everyone. Whether you are a veteran or a beginner, you will always find something new here at Titan. The journey never stops.

#### 😍 You can start playing now for free

Creating an account is as easy as signing in with your Steam account or joining any one of our servers. Don't worry, we do not see any of your login details. Steam only provides us your display name, avatar and Steam ID.

#### ☁️ Seamless integration with cloud data save synchronization

While using our website with the MOTD browser in a game, a session is automatically generated for you to access the website seamlessly.

And when you update your loadout through the browser, the changes you make on the website loadout are automatically reflected in the game, instantly.

#### 📂 Download and install our DLC to up your game

Our custom content is made entirely optional for all players. No automatic downloads of any content for custom items when you connect to a game. You can opt-in and enjoy the wide variety of content we offer by joining the content distributor server.
